# DualPlay
Our team designed Dual Play that enables any 3D TV to display two different input sources with a full screen simultaneously while preserving image proportion and maintaining original frame rate with two pairs of polarized glasses. I programmed the realtime video processing part in Python and optimized the Bluetooth remote controller for proper display. 

This is the system drive.
